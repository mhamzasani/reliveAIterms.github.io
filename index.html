        <h1>ReliveAI App - Terms of Use</h1>

        <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 26th September 2024</p>

        <p>By accessing or using the ReliveAI App ("App"), you agree to adhere strictly to the following Terms of Use. Any violation of these terms will result in immediate termination of your access to the App, without warning or recourse. Additionally, legal action may be pursued if your usage constitutes a violation of applicable law or involves harm to others.</p>

        <h2>1. Acknowledgment of Model Limitations</h2>
        <p>ReliveAI employs an artificial intelligence model with inherent limitations. Users must recognize and accept the following conditions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>No Guarantee of Factual Accuracy:</strong> The model is not intended for nor capable of delivering accurate, reliable, or verified information. Any output should be treated as non-factual and not be relied upon for decision-making, reporting, or dissemination.</li>
            <li><strong>Bias and Harmful Output:</strong> This AI model may inadvertently reproduce or amplify harmful societal biases embedded in its training data. The user acknowledges this risk and agrees to monitor generated content responsibly.</li>
            <li><strong>Content Mismatch:</strong> The model may fail to follow prompts precisely or generate output that is completely unrelated. The user assumes all responsibility for managing such discrepancies.</li>
            <li><strong>Prompt Sensitivity:</strong> Model behavior is highly influenced by the nature of the prompt input. Inappropriate or harmful prompts can lead to unexpected or unethical outputs, for which the user is fully accountable.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Absolute Prohibitions on Use</h2>
        <p>Under no circumstances may the App, the model, or any of its derivatives be used for any of the following purposes. Violation of these prohibitions will result in permanent account lockout, reporting to legal authorities, and possible legal action:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Unlawful Activities:</strong> Any use that violates or circumvents applicable laws, whether local, state, national, or international, including hacking, data theft, or fraud.</li>
            <li><strong>Exploitation of Minors:</strong> Any use related to the solicitation, creation, acquisition, or dissemination of content that exploits, harms, or seeks to exploit or harm minors, including child exploitative material. Such actions will be reported to authorities immediately.</li>
            <li><strong>Dissemination of False Information:</strong> Deliberate generation or sharing of verifiably false, misleading, or harmful information intended to deceive, manipulate, or harm others.</li>
            <li><strong>Violation of Privacy:</strong> Any attempt to generate or disseminate personal data, including but not limited to addresses, social security numbers, financial information, medical data, or any other sensitive data that could be used to harm, harass, or exploit individuals.</li>
            <li><strong>Harassment and Abuse:</strong> Using the model to harass, threaten, abuse, stalk, or bully any individual or group, whether directly or through generated content.</li>
            <li><strong>Illegal Pornographic Material:</strong> The creation or dissemination of any illegal, obscene, non-consensual, or pornographic content, including deepfake or synthetic media featuring real individuals without their consent.</li>
            <li><strong>Automated Decision Making:</strong> Using the App to perform fully automated decision-making processes that have legal, financial, or social consequences for individuals, including fraud, extortion, or unlawful surveillance.</li>
            <li><strong>Large-Scale Disinformation:</strong> Generating, disseminating, or contributing to disinformation campaigns, including but not limited to attempts to influence elections, public opinion, or disrupt civic institutions.</li>
            <li><strong>Content Manipulation:</strong> Using the model to alter or falsify images, videos, or other media with the intent to deceive or defraud, including identity theft or reputation damage.</li>
            <li><strong>Unauthorized Use for Business or Financial Gain:</strong> Using the App to conduct or assist in any unauthorized commercial activities, including but not limited to selling generated content without explicit permission from ReliveAI.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. User Responsibility and Liability</h2>
        <p>You are solely responsible for all content generated or shared using the App. Any violations of these Terms of Use will result in immediate suspension, termination, and reporting to authorities where appropriate. Users are responsible for ensuring the ethical and legal use of the App at all times. Failure to do so may result in legal liability and criminal prosecution.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>No Anonymity:</strong> ReliveAI reserves the right to retain and share user data with legal authorities if any breach of these terms is suspected, regardless of the user's attempt to conceal identity.</li>
            <li><strong>Accountability for Third-Party Use:</strong> You are responsible for any use of your account by third parties. Allowing others to use your account for prohibited purposes will result in the same consequences, including termination of access and potential legal actions.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Account Termination and Legal Recourse</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Immediate Lockout:</strong> Any user found to be engaging in prohibited activities will be locked out of their account immediately, without warning or notification.</li>

        <p>You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless ReliveAI, its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, and agents from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses (including legal fees and costs) arising from or in any way connected with your access to or use of the App, including any violations of these Terms of Use.</p>

        <h2>8. Amendments to Terms</h2>
